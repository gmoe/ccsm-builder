# Introduction to the Book

Queen are often misrepresented by hardcore fans as stalwart defenders of rock
and roll, as up until 1980 all of their albums had written into the liner notes
"No Synths!" or "Nobody played synthesizer". Let's correct this once and for
all through the immortal words of Brian May: 

> "There was no stipulation that we wouldn't have any synths, but the
> statement 'No synths' was printed on the album sleeves because of peoples'
> lack of intellect in the ears department. Many people couldn't hear the
> difference between a multitracked guitar and a synthesizer. We would spend
> four days multi-layering a guitar solo and then some imbecile from the
> record company would come in and say, 'I like that synth!'"
>
> Brian May, Queen Guitarist [^1]

Why is this relevant for a textbook on digital music? For the average person
with typical music taste (i.e. your Dad), there is an bit of apprehension to
music involving computers and technology. They have no frame of reference for
the effort involved in making music through non-conventional methods, so they
will erroneously believe that the "computer made it". This is akin to claiming
that a guitar is making the music rather than the guitarist, instead we are not
only playing our respective instrument, we make our own instruments.

This book will try to give readers a cursory knowledge of common topics within
the realm of digital music, filled with plenty of rabbit holes for dedicated
students to explore in. The goal is that interested students can research
topics on their own and decide which fields of study are worth dedicating their
time to.  Given that this book is an online resource, readers can jump between
the book and other resources linked in the chapter appendix.

This book will not cover much heavy math as there are many other books that do
a better job covering that material.[^2] The goal is to give the reader a
practical understanding of the science of music.

## Structure of the Book

This book covers three general knowledge areas: physics, music theory, and signal
processing. Some of these may sound intimidating depending on your current field
of study, however this book is written with no assumption of previous knowledge
so no one will be left behind. It can be surprising how high-level topics are
easily learned when they are presented with an ulterior goal, especially to a
passionate reader such as yourself. 

Each knowledge area is presented with some introductory material, filled with
practical and fun examples. If you already feel comfortable with one or more of
these topics, feel free to skip or skim the introductory sections and jump into
the meat of the chapters. Once a cursory knowledge is obtained, it will be
folded into other topics for some interesting overlaps.

## Software Used in the Book

Music software comes and goes, but techniques and strategies stick around.
This book is platform-agnostic; it covers broader topics such as synthesis
theory without diving deeply into the specifics of implementation.

However, this book does include code examples for several popular musical
programming languages such as Max, SuperCollider, and Faust. You can even
compare examples from each language, you might decide that you like another
language more than your current favorite!
