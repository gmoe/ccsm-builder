# Book 1: Theory

In this section, we will cover some of the basic math, neurophysiology, and
music theory required for the later sections. Even if you are familiar with
some of these topics, these chapters are worth skimming through to catch any
details you might not be aware of.

If you are an impatient reader, feel free to skip to the next section and come
back here later.
